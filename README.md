## Alcovia – High-Energy Landing Experience

This repository contains my implementation of the **Alcovia Full-Stack Engineering Challenge**.

The goal is to revamp Alcovia’s digital experience with a **high-energy, premium, and interactive landing page** inspired by [LandoNorris.com](https://landonorris.com). The site focuses on fluid motion, bold typography, and storytelling that reflects Alcovia’s mission of building future leaders.

---

## Tech Stack

- **Framework:** Next.js 16 (App Router, TypeScript)
- **UI:** React 19
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS v4
- **Animation & Motion:** GSAP, Lenis (smooth scrolling)

---

## Features & Sections

- **Hero Section (Entry)**  
  Large, high-impact hero with layered visuals, parallax-style motion, and smooth entrance animations. This is the primary brand moment.

- **Custom "Alcovian" Cursor**  
  Custom cursor that represents an Alcovian with a wing-like motion/physics that reacts to pointer movement, contributing to the premium, playful feel.

- **Manifesto Section**  
  Bold, justified "wall of text" typography inspired by the Lando Norris reference.
  Includes the required manifesto copy:

  > "Unprecedented Learnings, Failing regularly, building with friends, while being on a journey of self discovery. Get on a legacy building journey today, to build the future of tomorrow."

  This section transitions into the offerings as you scroll.

- **Offerings Lifestyle Grid**  
  A visually rich grid that showcases Alcovia’s key program elements:

  1. Career Discovery workshops  
  2. Podcast shoots with industry experts  
  3. 1:1 mentorship with top professionals  
  4. Scientifically build academic score  
  5. Forge bonds with similarly driven teens  
  6. Weekly mentorship from Harvard & UCL professionals  
  7. Monthly career counsellor meetings  
  8. Build resilience  
  9. Build empathy

- **"At School" vs "Outside of School" Toggle**  
  An interactive toggle component with fluid transitions (e.g. masked/slide animations) that switches content between:

  - **At School:** "How Alcovia helps students ace school."
  - **Outside of School:** "How Alcovia fulfills its mission of building differentiation for each Alcovian."

- **Socials & Footer**  
  Fanned-out social cards (like playing cards in a hand) linking to Alcovia’s socials (e.g. LinkedIn, Instagram).  
  On hover, cards spread, tilt, and/or scale to encourage interaction and provide a premium finish to the page.

## Screenshots

Custom preview images of the implementation are available in:

- `public/pages/not-found.png` – custom 404 / not-found page preview.

You can use these for quick visual reference or when sharing the project.

---

## Getting Started

### 1. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 2. Run the development server

```bash
npm run dev
```

Then open **http://localhost:3000** in your browser.

---

## Production Build

```bash
npm run build
npm start
```

This creates an optimized production build and starts the Next.js server.

---

## Project Structure (High Level)

- `app/` – Next.js App Router entry (`layout.tsx`, `page.tsx`, `not-found.tsx`, global styles).
- `components/` – All UI components, including:
  - `hero/` – Hero visuals, background, and content.
  - `manifesto/` – Manifesto layout and background.
  - `offerings/` – Offerings grid and cards.
  - `toggle/` – "At School" vs "Outside of School" interactive toggle.
  - `socials/` – Social cards and footer interactions.
- `public/` – Static assets (logos, icons, screenshots).

---

## Notes on Craft & Performance

- **Motion & Feel:** GSAP timelines and easing are tuned for smooth, premium-feeling motion. Lenis provides inertial/smooth scrolling.
- **Responsiveness:** Layouts are built with responsive Tailwind utilities to work across mobile, tablet, and desktop.
- **Code Quality:** Components are broken down by section, with clear separation of layout, motion, and data where appropriate.

This project is intended as a **portfolio-ready implementation** of the Alcovia landing experience and a demonstration of engineering craft around motion, UX, and front-end architecture.
